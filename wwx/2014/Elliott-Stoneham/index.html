To keep my costs under control, I wanted the same user interface code to run on all of the devices students use. Looking around, only Haxe, OpenfL/NME/Lime held the promise of being able to do this in a truly open-source way.</p><p>But I also wanted to write my software in Go, and so I got sidetracked into writing my transpiler.</p><h2><a id="What-problem-does-Haxe-solve-for-you?" type="text/html" href="#What-problem-does-Haxe-solve-for-you?"><span></span></a>What problem does Haxe solve for you?</h2><p>I want to write a single set of Go code that works in every environment I need it to. But while server-side Go implementations are already operating at Google-scale, client-side Go implementations are currently patchy. So transpiling my Go code into Haxe and using the OpenFL API offers the tantalizing prospect of writing truly cross-platform client-side code.</p><h2><a id="What-tips-or-resources-would-you-recommend-to-a-new-Haxe-user?" type="text/html" href="#What-tips-or-resources-would-you-recommend-to-a-new-Haxe-user?"><span></span></a>What tips or resources would you recommend to a new Haxe user?</h2><p>Do not depend on the documentation.

It would provide a consistent low-level API across all of the Haxe targets, with poly-fill functions where required for:</p><li>the full set of 8/16/32/64/128-bit numeric data-types, including complex</li><li>strings (<a title="#golang" rel="nofollow" href="http://golang.org">Go</a> uses UTF-8 as standard, but also handles UTF-16 and Unicode runes)</li><li>pointers</li><li>concurrency (threads and locking) and</li><li>specific functions to make code generation easier.</li><p></p><h2><a id="What-is-the-best-use-of-Haxe-you've-come-across?" type="text/html" href="#What-is-the-best-use-of-Haxe-you've-come-across?"><span></span></a>What is the best use of Haxe you've come across?</h2><p>So far the games industry have been the biggest users of Haxe, but it is now time for the ecosystem to move into the mainstream.</p><h2><a id="What-do-you-see-for-the-future-for-Haxe/OpenFL?" type="text/html" href="#What-do-you-see-for-the-future-for-Haxe/OpenFL?"><span></span></a>What do you see for the future for Haxe/OpenFL?</h2><p>Obviously I would like to see <a title="#golang" rel="nofollow" href="http://golang.org">Go</a> as a Haxe target, complete with a Go implementation of the Haxe standard library. Go has most of the advantages of C++, without the disadvantage of the very slow compilation times. It also has excellent concurrency support built into the language and a well-proven http server built into the runtime. It would provide a very strong server-side Haxe implementation.</p><p>But beyond that, my dream for Haxe is as the hub of a giant transpiler project, allowing code in one language to be translated into another. So not just <code>Go->Haxe->JS</code>, but also <code>JS->Haxe->Go</code>, or <code>FORTRAN->Haxe->C#</code> etc.</p><p>There would be two main objectives, both of which should save users money:</p><li>the first would be library code re-use, taking existing code from one language and using it in another and</li><li>the second would be the ability for each of the source languages to use the OpenFL cross-platform API.</li><p></p><p>To achieve this, Haxe would need to be generated by language compilers, instead of specific target object/assembler code. But since many compiler tool-chains and languages (like Go) already contain libraries to implement the front-end of a compiler, only the Haxe code-generation element needs to be written for each language.</p><p>And some languages share the same compiler chain, for example LLVM (C/C++/Objective-C natively, plus projects for Ruby, Python, Haskell, Java, D, PHP, Pure and Lua targeting LLVM) and GCC (C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, Ada, and Go), so writing Haxe code generation for these compiler chains would be very time-efficient.</p><p>I realize that due to practical considerations, only a sub-set of each language may be able to work in this way, and that the auto-generated Haxe code will be much larger than if it was hand-translated. But provided that the supported language sub-set is large enough to be useful, and that the target environment is fast enough to cope with a little inefficiency, a Haxe-based universal language translator would be very valuable tool.</p><p>So valuable in fact, that Haxe, with its universal language translator and cross-platform API, would become an essential part of every software developer's toolkit.</p><h2><a id="Sell-your-wwx2014-session!" type="text/html" href="#Sell-your-wwx2014-session!"><span></span></a>Sell your wwx2014 session!</h2><p>If you're interested in making Haxe a more significant force in the software industry, come and hear me speak.</p><h2><a id="What-is-the-best-part-of-wwx-for-you?" type="text/html" href="#What-is-the-best-part-of-wwx-for-you?"><span></span></a>What is the best part of wwx for you?</h2><p>As I've not attended WWX before, please come and ask me this question during the event, I'm looking forward to meeting you!</p></section></div></article><footer class="grid"><div class="grid-1-1"><svg viewBox="0 0 320 320" enable-background="new"><g><g id="a" transform="translate(-2,-2)"><path stroke-width="15.6" stroke="#000" d="m93.7 25.3-68.4 68.3" stroke-linecap="round" fill="none"></path><path stroke-width="15.3" stroke="#000" id="b" d="m52.4 153 36.6-37" stroke-linecap="round" transform="translate(2)" fill="none"></path><path stroke-width="14" stroke="#000" d="m271 22.5-246 246" stroke-linecap="round" fill="none"></path><use height="1052.3622" y="0" x="0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#b" width="744.09448" transform="translate(60,-60)"></use></g><use height="1052.3622" y="0" x="0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#a" width="744.09448" transform="matrix(-1 0 0 -1 332 331)"></use></g></svg></div></footer></body></html>
