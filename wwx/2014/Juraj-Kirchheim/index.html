I hate writing self-descriptions.</p><h2><a id="Where-do-you-get-your-inspiration?" type="text/html" href="#Where-do-you-get-your-inspiration?"><span></span></a>Where do you get your inspiration?</h2><p>Far too many places. The world is full of blue prints for a better future. I hate to admit it, but my problem is implementation rather than inspiration.</p><h2><a id="Which-creatives/developers/artists-do-you-admire-most?" type="text/html" href="#Which-creatives/developers/artists-do-you-admire-most?"><span></span></a>Which creatives/developers/artists do you admire most?</h2><p>If I really had to make a ranking probably <a title="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markaby" href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCQNm6yiZh0">substack</a> would come first.</p><p>I am also a huge fan of <a title="//www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html" href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op3QLzMgSY&list=PL8FE88AA54363BC46">Abelson and Sussman</a>.</p><p>And I am humbled by many amazing people in the Haxe community, feeling very fortunate to get the chance to episodically exchange ideas with them.</p><h2><a id="What-contributions-are-you-proud-of?" type="text/html" href="#What-contributions-are-you-proud-of?"><span></span></a>What contributions are you proud of?</h2><p>For years I've spend many if not most of my waking hours answering questions in communities like stackoverflow. Not so much lately, although I still try to be helpful in the Haxe group. <del>Teaching</del> Trying to teach is a great method of truly understanding and offering help is an important aspect of building communities.</p><p>Haxe is also something I feel a part of ever so slightly. Not in the sense that I consider my contribution outstanding in any way. But I do take pride in having stuck to Haxe for almost 5 years now and being one of the many who makes this community a crowd. And occasionally managing to propose a decent idea to the compiler team.</p><p>I also like to think that some things I was able to implement in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://github.com/haxetink/">Tinkerbell</a> are actually useful and quite well executed.</p><h2><a id="Did-your-contributions-bring-you-work-opportunities?" type="text/html" href="#Did-your-contributions-bring-you-work-opportunities?"><span></span></a>Did your contributions bring you work opportunities?</h2><p>Contributing, like any act of giving, leads to growth. Which mostly gives me a sense of fulfillment, but no doubt becoming better always opens new doors.</p><p>To answer the question as it was probably meant, my public activity has indeed occasionally lead to intriguing offers and positive anticipation during interviews.</p><h2><a id="Do-you-use-them-in-your-projects?" type="text/html" href="#Do-you-use-them-in-your-projects?"><span></span></a>Do you use them in your projects?</h2><p>As for my modest contribution to Haxe, I rely on it constantly, using Haxe in commercial projects since five years and almost exlusively since two.</p><p>Regarding Tinkerbell, it is my personal utility belt for almost everything I do. There's no part of it, that doesn't run in some client's production code. Nothing substitutes a real world field test.</p><h2><a id="How-did-you-get-started-with-Haxe?" type="text/html" href="#How-did-you-get-started-with-Haxe?"><span></span></a>How did you get started with Haxe?</h2><p>For a couple of years AS2 and PHP were my main language stack. And particularly PHP was killing me. Haxe was really exciting and I had finally managed to transition my commercial work with Haxe/php. Oh the irony.</p><h2><a id="What-problem-does-Haxe-solve-for-you?" type="text/html" href="#What-problem-does-Haxe-solve-for-you?"><span></span></a>What problem does Haxe solve for you?</h2><p>At the risk of sounding overenthusiastic, I would say it gives me something to truly believe in. Since I have been using Haxe, my stance on how you should or shouldn't be programming has gone back and forth between opposite ideas, but I didn't really doubt Haxe in all that time.</p><h2><a id="What-tips-or-resources-would-you-recommend-to-a-new-Haxe-user?" type="text/html" href="#What-tips-or-resources-would-you-recommend-to-a-new-Haxe-user?"><span></span></a>What tips or resources would you recommend to a new Haxe user?</h2><p>The most important tip is to regard Haxe as a completely different language. Personally, I long thought of Haxe as some kind of portable ActionScript 3 with weird features bolted on, but with other features missing. This proved an obstacle in unlocking Haxe's true potential for me.</p><p>As for resources, I consider the Haxe community the most important one. And also other Haxe code. Personally, I learn a lot from reading Nicolas' code. Particularly <a href="//code.google.com/p/hscript/">hscript</a> was a true eye opener.</p><h2><a id="What-Haxe-libraries-are-you-impressed-by?" type="text/html" href="#What-Haxe-libraries-are-you-impressed-by?"><span></span></a>What Haxe libraries are you impressed by?</h2><p>Well, as I said hscript really blew my mind at the time. Of the more recent stuff <a title="//github.com/aduros/flambe" href="//github.com/misprintt/mockatoo">mockatoo</a> is quite impressive.</p><h2><a id="What-problem-would-you-like-to-see-solved-by-a-new-or-existing-Haxe-library?" type="text/html" href="#What-problem-would-you-like-to-see-solved-by-a-new-or-existing-Haxe-library?"><span></span></a>What problem would you like to see solved by a new or existing Haxe library?</h2><p>I would really like to see some of the bigger libraries to be split up and to start sharing some code. That I think would work toward reducing the prevalent problem of duplicate effort in our community.</p><h2><a id="What-is-the-best-use-of-Haxe-you've-come-across?" type="text/html" href="#What-is-the-best-use-of-Haxe-you've-come-across?"><span></span></a>What is the best use of Haxe you've come across?</h2><p>Oh boy, I can't really answer that. I think what's best about all use of Haxe is the incredible diversity and picking a few things in particular couldn't do that any justice.</p><h2><a id="What-do-you-see-for-the-future-for-Haxe/OpenFL?" type="text/html" href="#What-do-you-see-for-the-future-for-Haxe/OpenFL?"><span></span></a>What do you see for the future for Haxe/OpenFL?</h2><p>I am not using OpenFL so I can't comment on that. As for Haxe itself, I see the current growth continue steadily. The technology will continue to mature and evolve, spreading its tentacles into every possible direction. Muahahahahaha!</p><p>We've seen Haxe become an increasingly reliable choice and that is and should remain our main focus. Even though it would be cool, I doubt think we'll really hit the mainstream in under five years. It's just something to get comfortable with. The road to world domination is long.</p><p>I hope we can keep up the sense of community that we have now as we expand.</p><h2><a id="Sell-your-wwx2014-session!" type="text/html" href="#Sell-your-wwx2014-session!"><span></span></a>Sell your wwx2014 session!</h2><p>I am really not a sales person, as you may have noticed if you've read this far.</p><p>But, let me try: Order now and lose 50% code in under a week!!!</p><h2><a id="What-is-the-best-part-of-wwx-for-you?" type="text/html" href="#What-is-the-best-part-of-wwx-for-you?"><span></span></a>What is the best part of wwx for you?</h2><p>Hanging out with the gang!</p></section></div></article><footer class="grid"><div class="grid-1-1"><svg viewBox="0 0 320 320" enable-background="new"><g><g id="a" transform="translate(-2,-2)"><path stroke-width="15.6" stroke="#000" d="m93.7 25.3-68.4 68.3" stroke-linecap="round" fill="none"></path><path stroke-width="15.3" stroke="#000" id="b" d="m52.4 153 36.6-37" stroke-linecap="round" transform="translate(2)" fill="none"></path><path stroke-width="14" stroke="#000" d="m271 22.5-246 246" stroke-linecap="round" fill="none"></path><use height="1052.3622" y="0" x="0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#b" width="744.09448" transform="translate(60,-60)"></use></g><use height="1052.3622" y="0" x="0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#a" width="744.09448" transform="matrix(-1 0 0 -1 332 331)"></use></g></svg></div></footer></body></html>
